# Implementation Plan: EHR Dashboard

**Branch**: `[ehr-dashboard]`
**Spec**: specs/ehr-dashboard-spec.md
**Date**: September 27, 2025

## Phased Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Prisma Setup
- Set up Supabase project (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- Initialize Prisma in the Next.js project
- Define complete database schema in `schema.prisma` (FHIR R4-aligned)
- Run initial migration to create tables in Supabase
- Implement Supabase Auth integration
- Create main application layout (Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS)

### Phase 2: Patient Management Hub
- Build core patient directory UI (list, search, view, add patients)
- Implement all patient CRUD operations using Prisma Client
- Enforce RLS for all patient data access

### Phase 3: Smart Documentation System
- Integrate Vercel AI SDK for clinical note generation and voice-to-text
- Save generated notes to database via Prisma Client
- UI for note creation, editing, and review

### Phase 4: Advanced Data Visualization
- Develop analytics dashboard (interactive charts for clinical metrics)
- Fetch and aggregate data for charts using Prisma Client
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness

### Phase 5: AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support
- Integrate AI for risk assessment, diagnostic assistance, drug interaction checks
- Use Prisma to query relevant patient data for AI prompts
- Display AI results in patient record view

### Phase 6: Communication & Workflow Tools
- Implement secure team messaging (real-time, persisted via Prisma)
- Build task management features (assign, track, complete tasks)
- UI for team chat and task board

### Phase 7: Finalization & Security Polish
- Full code review and optimization
- Audit and optimize all Prisma queries
- Configure and test Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase dashboard
- Validate HIPAA compliance, accessibility, and performance

## Technical Context
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router, RSC), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
